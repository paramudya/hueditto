### desc
(exclusively, at least for now)

### intricacy
- Works better when the query is already run and error info is prompted (instead of just fix the query before it's even run/checked by the engine)
- In case of multiple queries in the query box (separated by ';'), first (top) one is always picked. Be wary not to run (or even have) queries other than the first/top one

### version
v0.0 (24/12/24): 
    - jit for christmas: gpt 4o's powered sql query fixer. tested for a couple of queries, works okay. non streaming, no copy button yet
