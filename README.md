### desc
(exclusively, at least for now)

### intricacy
- Works better when the query is already run and error info is prompted (instead of just fix the query before it's even run/checked by the engine)
- In case of multiple queries in the query box (separated by ';'), first (top) one is always picked. Be wary not to run (or even have) queries other than the first/top one

### version
v0.0 (24/12/24): 
    - jit for christmas: gpt 4o's powered sql query fixer, server working on local office computer (mine) at the address http://127.0.0.1:5000
    - tested for a couple of queries, works okay. 
    - no streaming, no copy button, no queue yet
    - interface still hideous

v0.1 (in progress): 
    - priority: is there any way to get all the queries (not just ones displayed on the screen)
    - copy button ‚úÖ
    - server queue ‚è±Ô∏è
    - streaming ‚è±Ô∏è
    - model pick ü§î (maybe this ver maybe later)
    - deetect hive/impala for better query fix ü§î (maybe this ver maybe later)
